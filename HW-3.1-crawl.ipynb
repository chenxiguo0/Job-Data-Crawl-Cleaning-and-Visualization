At NASA, you’ll have an opportunity to work on unique and challenging projects that truly make an impact on humanity.\\n\\nWe are seeking a Data Scientist to join an exciting on-orbit NASA mission located in Greenbelt, MD. The ICE, Cloud, and Land Elevation, Satellite (ICESat-2) Mission is a laser altimeter with a single instrument, the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) which was launched on September 15, 2018. ICESat-2 makes height measurements globally, over sea ice covered regions these height measurements are converted to freeboard and thickness using a suite of algorithms developed by the project. ICESat-2 is expected to create a decadal-scale time series of sea ice change extending back to the launch of ICESat in 2003 and which makes use of other satellite and airborne missions after the failure of ICESat in 2009. This task provides for the continued evaluation of data required to produce this time series from ICESat-2 and refinement of the products. All code is expected to be integrated into an existing Github environment for shared work across the group of researchers working on the products.\\n\\nThe successful candidate will support the on-orbit evaluation, development, and visualization of ICESat-2 sea ice data products. These products are the retrieved surface elevation, surface type identification, and freeboard from the ATL07 and ATL10 data products (and associated ATL20 and ATL21 gridded products) as well as a NASA Goddard sea ice thickness research product. This task will also support the assessments towards the evaluation and further development of ICESat-2 data in conjunction with other satellite and airborne data sets such as CryoSat-2 and other project directed airborne campaigns. Specifically, the successful candidate will:\\n• Support assessments of the ATL07/10 along-track and ATL20/21 gridded data products. This will be done through the development of new data visualization tools such as mapping and plotting routines which explore different temporal and spatial aspects of the data. Comparisons of ATL07/10 data with airborne laser altimetry and imagery will also be done using heritage retrieval algorithms and will also support the evaluation of new algorithm approaches.\\n• Help develop and provide support for GSFC sea ice thickness products. This work includes the development of new visualization tools for the data set, testing of new algorithm approaches, development, and maintenance of scripts for the automated daily generation of the sea ice thickness product, and incorporation of new routines as needed to the master Python code used to generate the sea ice thickness data set. Data will be reprocessed as required.\\n• Support comparisons of the ICESat-2 elevation, freeboard, and thickness data products with satellite and in-situ data products including CryoSat-2, undersea mooring data, and EM bird measurements.\\n\\nRequired Experience:\\n• At least three years’ experience in scientific programming is required.
