    "Write either a function, or a class, that performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a given CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the function on both of your cleaned CSV files that you created from your job description crawl. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore feature distributions and relationships\n",
    "- Uncover trends, patterns, and correlations\n",
    "- Consider incorporating a geo-spatial analysis where appropriate\n",
    "  - Folium is a great tool for this: https://realpython.com/python-folium-web-maps-from-data/ \n",
    "- Visualize data effectively\n",
    "- Make sure your results are highly visual with high quality plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "By focusing on these steps, you'll extract valuable insights and inform deeper analysis of your job descriptions dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some possible things to focus on, you can add more on top of these, and you don't have to do all of them, but aim to produce the highest quality results possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Focus on a few cases that are most interesting to you, the points below are just ideas, there isn't anything specifically that you \"need to do\", the only thing you need to do is **take the assignment seriously, think critically, and make a high quality professional demonstration of EDA as applied to this dataset**\n",
